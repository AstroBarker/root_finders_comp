# root_finders_comp
comparison of some root finders in C++

Purpose is to compare some root finders, in C++, on non-linear problems.

Anderson accelerated Newton iteration can outshine standard Newton iteration on "hard" or expensive functions.

## Root finders implemented
 - Fixed Point
 - Newton
 - Newton (Anderson accelerated)

## Root Finders To Implement
 - Fixed point (Anderson accelerated)
 - Bisection
 - Regula Falsi
